	 Method called to validate the URL response.

	 A use-case of this validator would be to verify we get a 200 something from the server.
	 
	 The retry providers will still be called if this method returns an error.
	 
	 - Note: The closest API to this one in the data task session delegate is asynchronous
	 (method is `urlSession(:,dataTask:,didReceive:,completionHandler:)`).
	 I do not know why the method is asynchronous.
	 Considering this and the fact we cannot validate responses properly in an asynchronous manner for download tasks,
	 weâ€™ve decided to make this API synchronous. */
