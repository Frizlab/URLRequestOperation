/**
 The global configuration for RetryingOperation.
 
 You can modify all of the variables in this struct to change the default behavior of RetryingOperation.
 Be careful, none of these properties are thread-safe.
 It is a good practice to change the behaviors you want when you start your app, and then leave the config alone.
 
 - Note: We allow the configuration for a generic `Logger` (from Apple’s swift-log repository), **and** an `OSLog` logger.
 We do this because Apple recommends using `OSLog` directly whenever possible for performance and privacy reason
 (see [swift-log’s Readme](https://github.com/apple/swift-log/blob/4f876718737f2c2b2ecd6d4cb4b99e0367b257a4/README.md) for more informations).
 
 The recommended configuration for Logging is to use `OSLog` when you can (you are on an Apple platform that supports `OSLog`) and `Logger` otherwise.
 You can also configure both if you want, though I’m not sure why that would be needed.
 
 In the future, OSLog’s API should be modified to match the swift-log’s one, and we’ll then probably drop the support for OSLog
 (because you’ll be able to use OSLog through Logging without any performance or privacy hit). */
